= Gradle API Redistribution

As part of the Gradle toolbox project, the Nokee team is redistribution the Gradle API JARs with its source for Gradle 2.14 and newer.
Plugin authors can target specific Gradle API versions while building with any Gradle versions.
Head over to link:https://nokee.dev/docs/nightly/samples/gradle-plugin-development-runtime-compatibilities/[the Gradle runtime compatibilities sample] to see them in action.

== Usage

Apply the following plugin in your `settings.gradle[.kts]`:

[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
plugins {
    id("dev.gradleplugins.gradle-plugin-development") version("{jbake-version}")
}
----

NOTE: Head over to link:https://nokee.dev/docs/nightly/manual/gradle-plugin-development-plugin.html[the reference chapter] to learn more about the `dev.gradleplugins.gradle-plugin-development` plugin.

Then add the project repository in your build script, e.g. `build.gradle[.kts]`:

[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
    gradlePluginDevelopment()
}
----

Finally, add a dependency on the Gradle API of your choice, i.e. Gradle API 4.9:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    compileOnly(gradleApi("4.9"))
}
----
